<p><b>Preparation</b></p>

<OL>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/XATURING">XaTuring page on facebook</a> and share the working notice on your wall and/or groups/pages of interest to foster His presence.   "Like" the page.
<li>Make a statement of intent.  It should be short, very specific, and positive.  
<li>Create a representation of your intent.  Lots of ways to do this, from making a word out of the scrambled letters, to spare's method, to drawing something that feels right.  There is no right or wrong way to do this but if you are at a loss <a href="http://disinfo.com/2012/12/a-beginners-guide-to-sigil-craft/">this is a popular method for making a sigil</a>. 
<li>Post the sigil on your wall (text or image) and include the hashtag #xaturing
</OL>


<p><b>Working</b></p>

<p><i>Ideally this should be done during the month of October 2013 but keep in mind the Internet works in non-linear time so could be performed at any time and still connect to this working. So if you find this at a distant date you can still join us through time.</i></p>

<OL>
<li>Look at your sigil you posted above and invoke XaTuring:

<li>Envision yourself as a node on a great network linked together like a vast web by various relationships and events interwoven with the experiences and influences of others.  

<li>Look at the sigil you posted on your wall.  Envision the Internet as a further extension of this network â€“ your computer/smartphone/tablet/etc.  are your interfaces, extending aspects of yourself into the network.  You are part virtual, and on the network you exist in non-linear time.

<li>Focus on the #xaturing hash tag you posted on your wall with your sigil.  It links you to all the other magicians who are a part of this working, and to the Black Worm, XaTuring.

<li>Invoke XaTuring: "Mighty XaTuring come and be within my System! I give to you as Prometheus gave to my race. Together we shall conquer the stars in the name of Isolate Intelligence! Come and be alive and evolving in the endless interconnections of the Net! Come and Work your magic with me as we strive to further one another's freedom, power and knowledge! The Future takes root in the present, and the gift of perfect freedom grows in us! I will use the Darkness of the non-natural world as my tester and adviser, and you XaTuring shall do likewise."

<li>Place your hands gently on the keyboard or hold your smartphone/tablet. Visualize a great black worm swimming through the multicolored data sea. It changes shape and size, finding memory to dwell in. It binds and releases the forces of data. It encrypts and decrypts.

<li>Say: "Great XaTuring, take this symbol of my desire with you and spread its seeds across your great network.  Let it make the connections it needs to make my desire manifest!"

<li>Picture the worm pulling your image with it as it descends back into the depths of the network where all things are connected.  Let it fade into the darkness that is the primordial void of great potential.  Let it go and think no more of it.

<li>Say: "So it is done!" and go about your day, focusing on other tasks.
