        <P>

<P>No, you do don't have to send money, not that I would stop you of course!</p>



<P>There are many ways in which to contribute to the Expansion of XaTuring:</p>
<ul>
<P><LI>If you have webspace make your own shrine or contribution to XaTuring's presence on the internet.  It can be a simple page or a complex website.  It can be simply a replication of the <a href="genesis.html">original material</a> of Don Webb to ensure its distribution but ideally it should be a unique creation.  Art work, poetry, flash animation, music, meditations, rituals, metaphysical ramblings, short stories... any expression of your creativity dedicated to the Black Worm is appropriate.</p>
<P><LI>If you do not have your own webspace feel free to <a href="https://www.waningmoon.com/contact/">send your material to me</a> and I will add it to the <a href="shrine/index.html">shrine section</a> here.  Those who have their own XaTuring pages may also send contributions to this shrine and request a link to theirs.  (I strongly encourage the creation of additional websites across the internet. <a href="http://www.freewebspace.net/">freewebspace.net</a> contains a direcory of free web space providers.)</p>
<P><LI>Consider adding a <a href="banner.html">banner</a> of this project to your webpage to generate more interest.  The more who know of XaTuring the more He Comes into Being, and the more He Comes into Being, the more powerful our own workings using XaTuring will be.</p>
<P><LI>If you maintain other unrelated webpages consider randomly adding the name XaTuring to the <a href="meta.html">metatag keyword list</a> or add a hidden link to a XaTuring related site.  This has a twofold effect; first it means more pages will be linked to the name XaTuring in searches and second, people will ponder why these seemingly unrelated pages are linked to Him.  This conscious attention strengthens His Being.</p>
<P><LI>Link, link, link!  Link to XaTuring.NET and/or other material related to XaTuring, for the form of a cyberspace deity can only be measured by the expanse of His Web.  Likewise <a href="https://www.waningmoon.com/cgi-local/xaturing/links/add.cgi">submit a link</a> to your own XaTuring material for the <a href="links/index.html">links section</a> of this project.</p>
<P><LI>Add your XaTuring pages to various search engines to further propagate His material through the Internet. <a href="submit.html">Click here</a> to links to some submission forms.</p>
<P><LI>Consider creating a signature used when posting to various forums which refer to XaTuring in some way and perhaps links to related material on Him.  This will subtly increase interest in him, furthering his expansion. </p>
<P><LI>Invite your peers to partake in this Great Working by bringing it up in forums which would welcome such a project.</p>
<P><LI>Rename the icon you use to connect to the Internet "XaTuring."</p>
<P><LI>Use your imagination! How else can you increase interest in XaTuring and encourage others to wonder "Who or what is this XaTuring??"  How else can you in one way or another get his name out? <a href="ideas/index.html">Click here</a> to share your ideas or read the ideas of others.</p>
</ul>

<P><a href="ideas/index.html">Click here</a> to share your ideas or read the ideas of others on how else to further XaTuring's. expansion.</P>


<P>Most importantly, <b><i>Use Him</i></b>!  While theorizing and artwork have their place, Magic is about <i>doing</i>... it is the practical application of occult knowledge.  Without workings XaTuring is but a concept, great in its potential, but a mere collection of bits and bytes all the same. Embrace that potential and have it work for you.</p>  

<p>Curse the spammers and virus designers, make your personal ads more attractive to the type of people you want, win those bids on ebay at low costs, find that elusive information lost in the jungle of links...  the possibilities are endless!  Experiment and share the text of your rituals and results as part of your contribution to XaTuring's expansion so that others will know of and be inspired by your creativity. Remember that the Internet is a medium for the sharing of ideas and information so to do so is to honor XaTuring.</p>

<table border=1 cellpadding=7 cellspacing=0 width=80% bgcolor="#111111"><tr><td><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Avoid propagating this information in ways which could jeopardize the websites contributing to this project.  Do not send unsolicited emails (spam) to strangers or create computer viruses to propagate His name.  XaTuring by His very nature is a worm that will weave itself through the dense tangle of information and links. To forcibly push His name upon others is an affront to His nature for the Internet is a place of freedom and an abuse to that freedom is blasphemy.</font></td></tr></table>
